This utility library contains OpenSCAD code that's common to a number of my projects. I created this for my own convenience and learning. If you find it useful, please feel free to use it in your own projects.

If you're looking for a more complete and powerful OpenSCAD library, check out [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2).
